#### QOSF_Task_3 Cohort 5

- Please open the Task3_Daniel_Mendez file for all the contents. Thank you!

# Important:
My initial approach to the problem completely shifted during the second to last day of my deadline(two weeks after I submitted my qosf application). I made an assumption that this was the quantum tic-tac-toe game. However, I asked one of the qosf staff if my assumption is correct, but it was not. It is actually classical tic-tac-toe. This completely shifted my approach to the problem. The solution I have here is a result of a few hours of work after I found out this was based off of classical tic-tac-toe(although I did spend more time on this problem but with a false assumption of this being quantum tic-tac-toe, and therefore that was irrelevant work). If given a bit more time, I could have given a better and complete analysis of my solution. Therefore, I apologize in advance for a poor presentation. However, I hope I may still be considered for the QOSF cohort5. Quantum Information, and Quantum Computing is very exciting and I would like to contribute to the field! Thank you for your time!
